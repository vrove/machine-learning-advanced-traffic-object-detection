# Advanced Traffic Object Detection

Welcome to the Advanced Traffic Object Detection project! This machine learning project uses Teachable Machine to classify various objects commonly found on roads and sidewalks. The model can identify and classify objects such as cars, motorbikes, potholes, road signs, traffic lights, trucks, pedestrians, and fire hydrants.

## Project Overview

The web-based interface allows users to initiate the image classification using the webcam. By clicking the "Start" button, the machine learning model processes the webcam feed in real-time, providing predictions for the detected objects. The project aims to enhance the understanding of machine learning in the context of traffic object detection.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Start" button to activate the webcam and initiate object detection.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow.js for machine learning model integration.
- Teachable Machine for training the image classification model.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the web interface.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the project.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web interface.
- `my_model/`: Directory containing the Teachable Machine model files.
